// Body of if...else With Only One Statement
// If the body of if...else has only one statement, we can omit { } in our programs. For example, you can replace

const number1 = 2;
if (number1 > 0) {
  console.log("The number is positive.");
} else {
  console.log("The number is negative or zero.");
}

const number2 = 2;
if (number2 > 0) console.log("The number is positive.");// if there is single statment we can use it without curly braces
else console.log("The number is negative or zero.");


// The number is positive.
