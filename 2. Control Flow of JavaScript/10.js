// Difference Between While and Do While Loop and For Loop
// while loop is a entry controlled loop
// do while loop is a exit controlled loop
// for loop is a entry controlled loop
//
// while loop is a loop which is used to iterate the code multiple times
// do while loop is a loop which is used to iterate the code multiple times
// for loop is a loop which is used to iterate the code multiple times
//
// While loop is used when you know the number of iterations
// Do while loop is used when you dont know the number of iterations
// For loop is used when you know the number of iterations
//
// In While Loop Control will not enter into the loop if the condition is false
// In Do While Loop Control will enter into the loop atleast once even if the condition is false
// In For Loop Control will not enter into the loop if the condition is false
