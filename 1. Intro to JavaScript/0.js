// History of JavaScript
/*
In 1995 There was a Browser Name Netscpae Navigator
They Thought That Should have a Programming Language Navigator
Which They can Interact With There Browser

Brendan Eich Was Working in Netscape Navigator
So Brendan Eich Created JavaScript in 10 Days In 1995


1st JavaScript Name was Mocha
2nd JavaScript Name was LiveScript

LiveScript Was Not Getting Popular

So at that Time JAVA was Popular and More Demanding

So They Changed LiveScript to JavaScript

Java and JavaScript both are Differnet Programming Languages

In 1996 Internet Explorer 
They Too Created a New Programming Languages Name as JScript

People got confused w hich langauge to use JavaScript OR JScript

So They Both Went to ECMA European Computer Manufactors Association

ECMA is a Standard Organization Where They Decide what to show on Browser and Behave on Internet and Differnet other Technologies

ECMA Script and JavaScript  are Same

Now ECMA is Standarisd So now its Called ECMA Script

ECMA Script ES1 : 1997
ES5 : 2009
ES6 : 2015 (Biggest Update of JS in History)
ES7 : 2016
ES8 : 2017
 

TC 39 ... Technical Community 39
They Decide What new features Should be Added In ECMA Script
